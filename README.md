# odin-landing-page

Project: Landing Page
This project consists of two page where the index file servers as the moodified and some added features. The other page is named 'structure' where this page is the original file I build from scratch and following the provided images from The Odin Project course where the output that will be building is nearly identical or nearest to the guide landing page(not pixel accurate but the idea on how it is structured and styled must be accomplished).
